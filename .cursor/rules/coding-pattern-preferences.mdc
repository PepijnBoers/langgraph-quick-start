# Coding pattern preferences

- Always prefer simple solution
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we donâ€™t have duplicate logic.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid wiring scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to the run once
- Avoid having files over 200-200 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming
